-   Complete Project Development Guide and submit individually on Canvas

-   **Collect beetle data (to be done during every lab this semester)**

    1.  Ask Averie if hypothesis + experiment are okay

    2.  Count adults and larvae (using dissection microscope) according to protocol outlined in the lab guide

    3.  Record data on your groups printed data sheet

        -   Data sheet will be kept with beetles
